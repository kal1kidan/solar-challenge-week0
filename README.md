# Solar Challenge – Week 0

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing solar energy datasets from different countries to enable comparison and regional ranking of solar potential. It includes end-to-end data handling from environment setup, data cleaning, profiling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns in solar irradiance, temperature, and wind data.

**Key Features:**

* Structured project repository with version control using Git.
* Isolated Python environment with required packages (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `jupyter`).
* Modular workflow with notebooks for each country’s dataset.
* EDA includes summary statistics, missing-value analysis, outlier detection, visualizations, correlations, and time-series analysis.
* Cleaned datasets stored in `data/` (ignored by Git) for reproducible analysis.

**Folder Structure:**

 I can also **make this README even shorter and catchier**, suitable for GitHub’s main page so it immediately explains the project in 2–3 lines. Do you want me to do that?
